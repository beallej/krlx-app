Your readme file (either readme.txt or readme.md), should be located at the top level of your repository, and should contain:

Project: KRLX

Client: Ibrahim Rabbani

Team members: Josie Bealle, Phuong Dinh, Maraki Ketema and Naomi Yamamoto

Description of KRLX:

Instruction:

As you clone the project, the Google Calendar API key will be missing. You will need to create a new file in the repository (folder KRLX) named GoogleCalCredentials.txt. The text contains only the API key.

Do we need library installation? I think no right?

Note to future developers:
- If the website structure changes, certain aspects of the project will no longer be valid (News and recently Heard)

**Instructions, if any, on how to build your project. For most projects, this won't be required. But if, for example, your app requires a Google Maps API key, then your readme should link to instructions on how to get one, and then where to place it once you have it.
Instructions for how to install any external libraries required by your project. (You may provide instructions via a sentence saying the library is required, and then linking to installation instructions provided by the library's authors.)
A list of instructions to future developers on what they need to change to get the app ready for deployment. This may include brief descriptions of incomplete features, or the required attributes of a server, and anything else you think will show mercy to the people who handle your code in the future.
