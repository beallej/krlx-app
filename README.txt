Your readme file (either readme.txt or readme.md), should be located at the top level of your repository, and should contain:

Project: KRLX

Client: Ibrahim Rabbani

Team members: Josie Bealle, Phuong Dinh, Maraki Ketema and Naomi Yamamoto

Description of KRLX: KRLX is a iOS-based application (an application version of KRLX website). KRLX live streams KRLX Carleton radio and pulls articles from the website and displays them in a readable way. 
It will also integrate social media sharing options for the content, shows schedule of radio shows, displays which show is currently playing and have a playing song history of 5 most recently heard songs. 
The goal of creating this application is to enable more students enjoying and accessing KRLX radio, hence giving KRLX more listeners.

Instruction to install:

As you clone the project, the Google Calendar API key will be missing. You will need to create a new file in the repository (folder KRLX) named GoogleCalCredentials.txt. The text contains only the API key.
We use a SidebarMenu library (created by Simon Ng) which will be installed as you download and pull the repository.

------Do we need library installation? I think no right???----

Note to future developers:
- All basic functions are complete and functional. We commented our code extensively following Ibrahim's request.
- If the website structure changes, certain aspects of the project will no longer be valid (News and recently Heard). Future developement of this project can attempt to access the Joomla database which will potentially be more stable and fast.
